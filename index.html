        I am a hardworking software engineer who is focused on going above and beyond to support my team and serve customers. I am goal oriented and motivated to continue to grow as a full-stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have experience working with a variety of technologies, but the majority comes from the traditional web-stack. I have gotten a lot of Java/Groovy experience working with the Grails framework and also had some exposure to Angular. I stay agile throughout development cycles with a team-first focus and understand to plan an appropriate scope with the ability to adjust to changes along the way. I leverage my interpersonal skills when gathering requirements from the business which allow me to bridge the gap in communication. I'm a willing learner and not afraid to ask questions to clarify requirements to ensure high quality and efficiency. I learn quickly and am ready for the challenges this new opportunity brings.
